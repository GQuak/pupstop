## User Story

As a dog owner on the road, I want a place for my pup to run around, so that I don’t have to walk them near dangerous roads.
As a dog owner that lives in the city, I want to let my dog run around and play in a safe location so that we don't have to walk on a leash.
As the owner of a nervous or shy dog, I want to let my dog run around and play in an area that doesn’t have a lot of other dogs, so that they can get energy out without being stressed.

## Description

PupStop allows dog owners to rent backyards, providing a safe and controlled environment for some off-leash dog play! Locals can make money by hosting their yard or land, while helping dogs that need private spce to let off some steam. Owners can filter by the type of experience they are lookig for - enclosed areas, distraction-free zones, or puppy playdates.


## Usage

Dog owners can search for rentals by location and experience. Each yard has a description, image, and the option to leave reviews for other dog owners. When an ideal pup stop is chosen, owners must sign up to make a reservation. Once logged in, owners can view and manage their existing reservations on the "My Reservations" screen.

Hosts can sign up to host their yard on Pup Stop. Once logged in, hosts can view and manage their reservations in the "My Yard Reservations" screen.
